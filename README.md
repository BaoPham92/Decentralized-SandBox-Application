# About:

This is currently a sandbox using ReactJS to integrate blockchain technologies. Using [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/index.html) which is used upon the ([ETH](https://www.ethereum.org/) or Ethereum for decentralized applications.)

## Instructions: 
Download MetaMask (extension) for [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1sriBRD-ARIsABYdwwE9fD-LW_b1qDbDV9eROqzGYZZepnYdRqSrIWb2RWD3nNnFNZdFpXcaAovfEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) or [Brave(https://brave.com/) and create an account or log into one.

> - Run Ganache from either "CLI" or "Executable".
Use the following commands to get the sandbox project up and running after installing in a directory:

> - npm install
> - npm run start

## Todo:

1. Write up a solution for production in case if no one has a active MetaMask account. Using production environments for development such as [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/docs/ganache/overview) would be a useful tool for blockchain sandbox development. You are provided enough fake Ethereum in order to replicate transactions or even your smart contracts.
